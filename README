This implementation requires a C++17 compliant compiler and has been tested with:
	* g++ 9
	* g++ 10
	* clang 10

CMake & binaries are setup for unit testing. Only the headers in the "sh"
directory are necessary to use the Robinhood hashtable. Simply move them as a
group to a desired directory. Define NDEBUG during Release-type builds to
disable many asserts and debug iterators.

sh::openmap & sh::openset:
	* The interfaces are largely compatible with std::unordered_map and
	  std::unordered_set, respectively, but are not identical.
	* There are additional causes of iterator invalidation!
	* Also, the exception guarantees are somewhat weakened.
	* More details are recorded in robinhood.hpp.

I hope this is useful or at least interesting!
